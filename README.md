Visualization of data structures and algorithms using Python and Tkinter

[![Run it on repl.it](.repl.it.stuff/run_it_on_repl_it.svg)](https://repl.it/github/JMCanning78/datastructures-visualization)

This repository visualizes many basic data structures and algorithms to help new computer scientists understand them.
Most of the visualizations were designed to accompany a textbook, _Data Structures and Algorithms in Python_ by John Canning, Alan Broder, and Robert Lafore.
Interactive exploration of the algorithms along with analysis in the text deepens student understanding.

The implementation is in Python using its interface to Tk (tkinter) to animate the operations.

Exceptional students in the Computer Science Department of Stern College at Yeshiva University developed many of these visualizations.
